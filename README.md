# Replication code for XXX et al. (XXX) "XXX"

This repository holds all code required to replicate the results of:

[TODO]

## Software requirements

You need to install [julia](http://julialang.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to run the replication code.

## Preparing the software environment

On the julia side of things you need to install a number of packages. You can use the following julia code to do so:

````julia
Pkg.add("Mimi")
Pkg.add("DataFrames")
Pkg.add("RCall")
Pkg.add("ExcelReaders")
````

On the R side of things you also need to install a number packages. You can use the following R code to do so:

````R
install.packages("tidyverse")
````

## Cloning the repository

This git repository uses a git submodule. To ensure the submodule gets properly downloaded, make sure to use the
git ``--recurse-submodules`` option when cloning the repository. If you cloned the repository without that option,
you can issue the following two git commands to make sure the submodule is present on your system:
``git submodule init``, followed by ``git submodule update``.

## Running the replication script

To recreate all outputs for this paper, run the ``main.jl`` file in the folder ``src`` with this command:

````
julia src/main.jl
````

## Input files

### data/excel-performance.csv

The data in this file was generated by manually running the Excel version
of PAGE with the @RISK plugin. We started by opening the original PAGE Excel
file ``PAGE09 v1.7 default.xlsx`` in the 64 bit version of Microsoft
Excel 2016 on Windows 10. We used @Risk version 7.5.1 Build 146. The different
rows in the file correspond to runs where we modified two settings in the
``Simulation->Settings`` dialog: the ``Number of Iterations`` and the
``Multiple CPU Support`` setting. Each run was initiated by clicking the
``Start Simulation`` button. The elapsed time is the number @RISK reported
in the ``@RISK Simulating`` window.

The runs were performed on a system with an Intel Core i7-4770 @ 3.4GHz
CPU that had 16 GB of main memory.

## Result files

All results will be stored in csv files in the folder ``results``. The following files will be created by running the main script.

## Result plots

All plots for the paper will be stored in the ``plots`` folder.
